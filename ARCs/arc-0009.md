# Algorand Wallet Algodv2 and Indexer API

> This API is a draft.
> Some elements may change.
> Furthermore, this API is considered a stopgap solution.

## Summary

An API for accessing Algod and Indexer through a user's preferred connection.

## Abstract

Functions `getAlgodv2` and `getIndexer` which return the corresponding algosdk objects.

## Specification

### Interface `GetAlgodv2Function`

```ts
type GetAlgodv2Function = () => Promise<Algodv2>
```

Returns a promised `Algodv2`, where `Algodv2` is an interface matching the class `algosdk.Algodv2`.

### Interface `GetIndexerFunction`

```ts
type GetIndexerFunction = () => Promise<Indexer>
```

Returns a promised `Indexer`, where `Indexer` is an interface matching the class `algosdk.Indexer`.

## Rationale

Nontrivial DApps often require the ability to query the network for activity. Algorand DApps written without regard to wallets are likely written using `Algodv2` and `Indexer` from `algosdk`. This document is a very blunt approach to exposing identical querying functionality through a wallet, making it easy for JavaScript DApp authors to port their code to work with wallets.

We expect this document to be a stepping stone towards discovering better ways to expose the querying functionality that DApps need in order to function.
