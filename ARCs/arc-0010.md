# Algorand Wallet Reach Minimum Requirements

> This API is a draft.
> Some elements may change.
> Especially the part about LogicSigs.

## Summary

An amalgamation of APIs which comprise the minimum requirements for Reach to be able to function correctly with a given wallet.

## Abstract

A group of related functions:

* `enable`
* `signAndPostTxns`
* `getAlgodv2`
* `getIndexer`

## Specification

* `enable`: as specified in [ARC-0006](arc-0006.md).
* `signAndPostTxns`: as specified in [ARC-0008](arc-0008.md).
* `getAlgodv2` and `getIndexer`: as specified in [ARC-0009](arc-0009.md).

There are additional semantics for using these functions together.

### Semantic Requirements

* `enable` SHOULD be called before calling the other functions.
* If `signAndPostTxns`, `getAlgodv2`, or `getIndexer` are called before `enable`, they SHOULD throw an error.
* `getAlgodv2` and `getIndexer` MUST return connections to the network indicated by the `network` result of `enable`.
* `signAndPostTxns` MUST post transactions to the network indicated by the `network` result of `enable`
* The result of `getAlgodv2` SHOULD only be used to query the network. `signAndPostTxns` SHOULD be used to send transactions to the network. The `Algodv2` object MAY be modified to throw exceptions if the caller tries to use it to post transactions.

### Additional requirements regarding LogicSigs

`signAndPostTxns` must also be able to handle logic sigs. Callers are expected to sign the logic sig by themselves, rather than expecting the wallet to do so on their behalf. To handle this case, we adopt and extend the [ARC-0001](arc-0001.md) format for `WalletTransaction`s that do not need to be signed:

```json
{
  "txn": "...",
  "signers": [],
  "stxn": "..."
}
```

* `stxn` is a `SignedTxnStr`, as specified in [ARC-0007](arc-0007.md).
* This ARC will likely be updated or extended to require more information about the logic sig in order to allow the wallet to verify that `"txn"` and `"stxn"` match.

## Rationale

In order for a wallet to be useable by Reach, it must support features for account discovery, signing and posting transactions, and querying the network.

To whatever extent possible, the end users of a DApp should be empowered to select their own wallet, accounts, and network to be used with the DApp. Furthermore, said users should be able to use their preferred network node connection, without exposing their connection details and secrets (such as endpoint URLs and API tokens) to the DApp.

It is our intent that the APIs presented in this document and related documents are sufficient to cover the needed functionality, while protecting user choice and remaining compatible with best security practices.

## Sample usage

```js
async function main(wallet) {

  // Account discovery
  const enabled = await wallet.enable({network: 'testnet-v1.0'});
  const from = enabled.accounts[0];

  // Querying
  const algodv2 = await wallet.getAlgodv2();
  const suggestedParams = await algodv2.getTransactionParams().do();
  const txns = makeTxns(from, suggestedParams);

  // Sign and post
  const res = await wallet.signAndPost(txns);
  console.log(res);

};
```

Where `makeTxns` is comparable to what is seen in [ARC-0001](arc-0001.md)'s sample code.
