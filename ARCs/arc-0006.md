# Algorand Wallet Address Discovery API

> This API is a draft.
> Some elements may change.

## Summary

An API for a function used to discover the addresses a wallet user is willing to use for a given Algorand DApp.

## Abstract

A function, `enable`, which allows the discovery of accounts. This document requires nothing else, but further semantic meaning is prescribed to `enable` in [ARC-0010](ARC-0010.md) which builds off of this one and a few others.

## Specification

### Interface `EnableFunction`

```ts
export type EnableFunction = (
  opts?: EnableOpts
) => Promise<EnableResult>;

export interface EnableOpts = {
  network?: string;    // NetworkIdentifier
  accounts?: string[]; // AlgorandAddress[]
}

export interface EnableResult = {
  network: string;    // NetworkIdentifier
  accounts: string[]; // AlgorandAddress[]
}
```

An `EnableFunction` with input argument `opts:EnableOpts` and return value `ret:EnableResult`:

* MAY expect `opts.network` to be in the correct format as specified by `NetworkIdentifier`.
* MAY expect `opts.accounts` to be in the correct format as specified by `AlgorandAddress`.
* MUST return `network` in the format of `NetworkIdentifier`
* MUST return `accounts` in the format of an array of `AlgorandAddress`

### String specification: `NetworkIdentifier`

A `NetworkIdentifier` string must be in the format `"${network}-${id}"`, such as `"testnet-v1.0"` and `"mainnet-v1.0"`.

### String specification: `AlgorandAddress`

Quoting [ARC-0001](ARC-0001.md):

> An Algorand address is represented by a 58-character base32 string. It includes includes the checksum.

### Semantic requirements

Regarding a call to `enable(opts)` or `enable()` (where `opts` is `undefined`), with potential promised return value `ret`:

When `network` is specified in `opts`:

* The call `enable(opts)` MUST either throw an error or return an object `ret` where `ret.network` is identical to `opts.network`.
* The user SHOULD be prompted for permission to acknowledge control of accounts on that specific network.

When `network` is not specified in `opts`:

* The user SHOULD be prompted to select the network they wish to use.
* The function MAY throw an error if it does not support user selection of network.

When `accounts` is specified in `opts`:

* The call `enable(opts)` MUST either throw an error or return an object `ret` where `ret.accounts` is an array that starts with all the same elements as `opts.accounts`, in the same order.
* When `accounts` are specified in the `opts`, the user SHOULD be prompted for permission to acknowledge their control of the specified accounts. The wallet MAY allow the user to provide more accounts than those listed.

When `accounts` is not specified in `opts`:

* The user SHOULD be prompted to select the accounts they wish to reveal on the selected network.
* The call `enable(opts)` MUST either throw an error or return an object `ret` where `ret.accounts` is a non-empty array.
* The caller MAY assume that `ret.accounts[0]` is the user's "currently-selected" or "default" account, for DApps that only require access to one account.

## Rationale

This API puts power in the user's hands to choose a preferred network and account to use when interacting with a DApp.

It also allows DApp developers to suggest a specific network, or specific accounts, as appropriate. The user still maintains the ability to reject the DApp's suggestions, which corresponds to rejecting the promise returned by `enable()`.
