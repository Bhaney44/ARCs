# Algorand Wallet Transaction Signing API (Functionality Only)

> This API is a draft.
> Some elements may change.
> This ARC is intended to be completely compatible with [ARC-0001](ARC-0001.md).

## Summary

An API for a function used to sign a list of transactions on the Algorand blockchain.

## Abstract

[ARC-0001](ARC-0001.md) defines a standard for signing transactions with security in mind. This proposal is a strict subset of ARC-0001 that outlines only the minimum functionality required in order to be useable.

Wallets that conform to ARC-0001 already conform to this API.

## Specification

### Interface `SignTxnFunction`

```ts
export type SignTxnFunction = (
   txns: WalletTransaction[],
   opts?: any,
)
   => Promise<(string | null)[]>;
```

A `SignTxnFunction`:

* MAY expect `txns` to be in the correct format as specified by `WalletTransaction`.

### Interface `WalletTransaction`

```ts
export interface WalletTransaction {
   /**
    * Base64 encoding of the canonical msgpack encoding of a Transaction.
    */
   txn: string;
}
```

### Semantic requirements

* The call `signTxn(txns, opts)` MUST either throw an error or return an array `ret` of the same length as the `txns` array.
* Each element of `ret` MUST be the base64 encoding of the canonical msgpack encoding of the `SignedTxn` corresponding object, as defined in the [Algorand specs](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/specs).

## Rationale

This simplified version of ARC-0001 exists for two main reasons:

1. To outline the minimum amount of functionality needed in order to be useful.
2. To serve as a stepping stone towards full ARC-0001 compatibility.

While users would be wise to select a wallet that fully adheres to ARC-0001, this simplified API sets a lower bar and acts as a signpost for which wallets can even be used at all.
