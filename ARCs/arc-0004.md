# Algorand Transaction Calling Conventions

> This API is a draft.  Some elements may change.

## Summary

A standard for encoding contract call transactions to invoke methods
on an Algorand _Smart Contract_ (aka "stateful contract" or "app").

## Abstract

This document introduces conventions for encoding method calls,
including argument and return value encoding, in Algorand application
call transactions. The goal is to allow clients, such as wallets and
dapps, to properly encode call transactions based on a description of
the interface. Further, explorers will be able to show details of
these method invocations.

## Definitions

* **HLL:** a higher level language that compiles to TEAL bytecode.
* **dapp**: a decentralized application, interpreted here to mean an
  off-chain application (a webapp, native app, etc.) that interacts
  with smart contracts on the blockchain.
* **wallet**: an application that stores secret keys for on-chain
  accounts and can display and sign transactions for these accounts.
* **explorer**: an application that allows browsing the blockchain,
  showing details of transactions.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**",
"**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**",
"**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Overview

This document makes recommendations for encoding method invocations as
application call transactions, and for describing methods for
access by higher-level entities.  Encoding recommendations are
intended to be minimal, intended only to allow interoperability among
contracts.  Higher level recommendations are intended to enhance
user-facing interfaces, such as high-level language, dapps, and
wallets.  Apps that follow the recommendations described here are called
_ARC-4 Apps_.

### Methods

A method is a section of code intended to be invoked externally with
an application call transaction. A method must have a name, it may
take a list of arguments as input when it is invoked, and it may
return a single value (which may be a tuple) when it finishes
running. The possible types for arguments and return values are
described later.

Invoking a method involves creating an application call transaction to
specifically call that method. Methods are different from internal
"helper functions" that may exist in a contract, but are not
externally callable. In the future, applications will be able to invoke
methods from other applications, so it should be possible to build ABI
encoded byte arrays conveniently in the AVM.


#### Method Signature

A method signature is a unique identifier for a method. The signature
is a string that consists of the method's name, an open parenthesis, a
comma-separated list of the types of its arguments, a closing
parenthesis, and the method's return type, or `void` if it does not
return a value. The names of arguments are _not_ included in a
method's signature, and whitespace does not appear anywhere.

For example, `add(uint64,uint64)uint128` is the method signature for a
method named `add` which takes two uint64 parameters and returns a
uint128.  Signatures are encoded in utf-8, and method names may not
contain an open parenthesis or whitespace. For the benefit of universal
interoperability (especially in HLLs), names should be further
restricted to by the regular expression `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. The
preferred naming scheme for methods is camelCase.


#### Method Selector

Method signatures contain all the information needed to identify a
method, however the length of a signature is unbounded. Rather than
consume program space with such strings, a method selector is used to
identify methods in calls. A method selector is the first four bytes of
the SHA-512/256 hash of the method signature.

For example, the method selector for a method named `add` which takes
two uint64 parameters and returns a uint128 can be computed as
follows:

```
Method signature: add(uint64,uint64)uint128
SHA-512/256 hash (in hex): 8aa3b61f0f1965c3a1cbfa91d46b24e54c67270184ff89dc114e877b1753254a
Method selector (in hex): 8aa3b61f
```


#### Method Description

A method description provides further information about a method
beyond its signature. This description is encoded in JSON and consists
of a method's name, description, arguments (their types, names, and
descriptions), and return type (and possible description for the
return type). From this structure, the method's signature and selector
can be calculated. The Algorand SDKs will provide convenience
functions to calculate signatures and selectors from such JSON files.

These details will enable high-level languages and dapps/wallets to
properly encode arguments, call methods, and decode return
values. This description can populate UIs in dapps, wallets, and
explorers with description of parameters, as well as populate
information about methods in IDEs for HLLs.

The JSON structure for such an object is:

```
interface Method {
  name: string,
  desc?: string,
  args: Array<{ name: string, type: string, desc?: string }>,
  returns?: { type: string, desc?: string }
}
```

For example:

```
{
  "name": "add",
  "desc": "Calculate the sum of two 64-bit integers",
  "args": [
    { "name": "a", "type": "uint64", "desc": "..." },
    { "name": "b", "type": "uint64", "desc": "..." }
  ],
  "returns": { "type": "uint128", "desc": "..." }
}
```


### Interfaces

An interface is a logically grouped set of methods. All methods in an
interface must be unique (specifically, they must have unique method
selectors). Method names in interfaces **MUST NOT** begin with an
underscore. A smart contract implements an interface if it supports
all of the methods from that interface. A smart contract may implement
zero, one, or multiple interfaces.

#### Interface Description

An interface description is a JSON object containing the JSON
descriptions for each of the methods in the interface.

The JSON structure for such an object is:

```
interface Interface {
  name: string,
  methods: Array<Method>
}
```

For example:

```
{
  "name": "Calculator",
  "methods": [
    { "name": "add", "args": [...], ... },
    { "name": "multiply", "args": [...], ... }
  ]
}
```

### Contracts

A Contract is the complete set of methods that an app implements. It
is similar to an interface, but may include further details about the
concrete implementation. All methods in a Contract must be unique
(specifically, they must have unique method selectors). Method names
in Contracts **MAY** begin with underscore, but these names are
reserved for use by ARC specification.

A Contract may contain two special methods, `_optIn` and
`_closeOut`. These methods describe how callers can opt-in to
(allocate local state), or close-out from (deallocate local state),
such apps.  They may have any arguments or return values, but there
must be no more than one method with each name.

In the absence of such methods, ARC-4 Contracts **SHOULD** allow
accounts to perform the corresponding action with no arguments, or by
setting the associated OnCompletion value (OptIn = 1, CloseOut = 2)
while calling a method of the contract. ARC-4 Contracts **MAY** allow
OnCompletion values to be set to other values in order to support
methods that delete or update the contract. Of course, great care
should be taken when allowing these operations.

#### Contract Description

An contract description is a JSON object containing the JSON
descriptions for each of the methods in the contract.

The JSON structure for such an object is:

```
interface Contract {
  name: string,
  appId: number
  methods: Array<Method>
}
```

For example:

```
{
  "name": "Calculator",
  "appId": 1762763,
  "methods": [
    { "name": "add", "args": [...], ... },
    { "name": "multiply", "args": [...], ... }
  ]
}
```


## Method Invocation

In order for a caller to invoke a method, the caller and the method
implementation (callee) must agree on how information will be passed
to and from the method. This ABI defines a standard for where this
information should be stored and its format.


### Standard Format

The method selector will be the first application call argument,
accessible as `txn ApplicationArgs 0` from TEAL. For the two special
methods `_optIn` and `_closeOut`, the first ApplicationArg **MUST** be
empty. Instead, the OnCompletion (`apan`) field of the application
call transaction is set appropriately.

The first 14 method arguments will occupy the next 14 application call
arguments, accessible from TEAL as `txn ApplicationArgs i` for `1 <= i
<= 14`. The arguments will be encoded as defined in the Encoding
section.

If a method has more than 14 arguments, the remaining arguments will
be encoded as a tuple in the final application call argument,
accessible from TEAL as `txn ApplicationArgs 15`.

The return value of the method, if present, will be logged by the
method implementation. The value is returned by using the `log` opcode
to log a byte array with a four byte prefix followed by the encoding of
the value as defined in the Encoding section.  The four byte prefix is
defined by SHA-512/256("return").  It is 0x151f7c75.


### Implementing a Method

An ARC-4 app implementing a method:

1. **MUST** Examine `txn ApplicationArgs 0` to identify the selector
of the method being invoked. When `txn Application 0` is empty, the
Contract **MAY** inspect OnCompletion to determine if a special method
is being invoked. If the contract does not implement a method with
that selector, the call **MUST** fail.

2. branches to the body of the method indicated by the selector

3. The code for that method may extract the arguments it needs, if
any, from the application call arguments as described in the Encoding
section. If the contract needs to access any method arguments beyond
the 14th, it must decode `txn ApplicationArgs 15` as a tuple to access
the arguments contained in it.

4. If the method is non-void, the application **MUST** encode the
return value as described in the Encoding section and then `log` it
with the prefix 0x151f7c75.


### Calling a Method from Off-Chain

To invoke an ARC-4 app, an off-chain system, such as a dapp or wallet,
would first obtain the interface description JSON object for the
app. The client may now:

1. Create an application call transaction with the following parameters:
    1. Use the ID of the desired application whose approval program
       implements the method being invoked.
    2. Use the selector of the method being invoked as the first
       application call argument.
    3. Encode all arguments for the method, if any, as described in
       the Encoding section. Place up to 14 method arguments as the
       next 14 application call arguments. If more than 14 method
       arguments must be included, encode the remaining as a tuple
       into the final application call argument.
2. Submit this transaction and wait until it successfully commits to
   the blockchain.
3. Decode the return value, if any, from the ApplyData's log
   information.

Clients **MAY** ignore the return value.

## Encoding

This section describes how ABI types can be represented as byte strings.

Like the [EthereumABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/abi-spec.html), this
encoding specification is designed to have the following two
properties:


1. The number of non-sequential "reads" necessary to access a value is
   at most the depth of that value inside the encoded array
   structure. For example, at most 4 reads are needed to retrieve a
   value at `a[i][k][l][r]`.
2. The encoding of a value or array element is not interleaved with
   other data and it is relocatable, i.e. only relative “addresses”
   (indexes to other parts of the encoding) are used.


### Types

The following types are supported in the Algorand ABI.

* `uint<N>`: An `N`-bit unsigned integer, where `8 <= N <= 512` and `N % 8 = 0`.
* `byte`: An alias for `uint8`.
* `bool`: A boolean value that is restricted to either 0 or 1. When encoded, up to 8 consecutive `bool` values will be packed into a single byte.
* `ufixed<N>x<M>`: An `N`-bit unsigned fixed-point decimal number with precision `M`, where `8 <= N <= 512`, `N % 8 = 0`, and `0 < M <= 160`, which denotes a value `v` as `v / (10^M)`.
* `<type>[<N>]`: A fixed-length array of length `N`, where `N >= 0`. `type` can be any other type.
* `address`: Used to represent a 32-byte Algorand address. This is equivalent to `byte[32]`.
* `<type>[]`: A variable-length array. `type` can be any other type.
* `string`: A variable-length byte array (`byte[]`) assumed to contain UTF-8 encoded content.
* `(T1,T2,...,TN)`: A tuple of the types `T1`, `T2`, …, `TN`, `N >= 0`.

### Static vs Dynamic Types

For encoding purposes, the types are divided into two categories: static and dynamic.

The dynamic types are:

*  `<type>[]` for any `type`
    * This includes `string` since it is an alias for `byte[]`.
* `<type>[<N>]` for any dynamic `type`
* `(T1,T2,...,TN)` if `Ti` is dynamic for some `1 <= i <= N`

All other types are static. For a static type, all encoded values of
that type have the same length, irrespective of their actual value.


### Encoding Rules

Let `len(a)` be the number of bytes in the binary string `a`. The
returned value shall be considered to have the ABI type `uint16`.

Let `enc` be a mapping from values of the ABI types to binary
strings. This mapping defines the encoding of the ABI.

For any ABI value `x`, we recursively define `enc(x)` to be as follows:

* If `x` is a tuple of `N` types, `(T1,T2,...,TN)`, where `x[i]` is the value at index `i`, starting at 1:
    * `enc(x) = head(x[1]) ... head(x[N]) tail(x[1]) ... tail(x[N])`
    * Let `head` and `tail` be mappings from values in this tuple to binary strings. For each `i` such that `1 <= i <= N`, these mappings are defined as:
        * If `Ti` (the type of `x[i]`) is static:
            * If `Ti` is `bool`:
                * Let `after` be the largest integer such that all `T(i+j)` are `bool`, for `0 <= j <= after`.
                * Let `before` be the largest integer such that all `T(i-j)` are `bool`, for `0 <= j <= before`.
                * If `before % 8 == 0`:
                    * `head(x[i]) = enc(x[i]) | (enc(x[i+1]) >> 1) | ... | (enc(x[i + min(after,7)]) >> min(after,7))`, where `>>` is bitwise right shift which pads with 0, `|` is bitwise or, and `min(x,y)` returns the minimum value of the integers `x` and `y`.
                    * `tail(x[i]) = ""` (the empty string)
                * Otherwise:
                    * `head(x[i]) = ""` (the empty string)
                    * `tail(x[i]) = ""` (the empty string)
            * Otherwise:
                * `head(x[i]) = enc(x[i])`
                * `tail(x[i]) = ""` (the empty string)
        * Otherwise:
            * `head(x[i]) = enc(len( head(x[1]) ... head(x[N]) tail(x[1]) ... tail(x[i-1]) ))`
            * `tail(x[i]) = enc(x[i])`
* If `x` is a fixed-length array `T[N]`:
    * `enc(x) = enc((x[0], ..., x[N-1]))`, i.e. it’s encoded as if it were an `N` element tuple where every element is type `T`.
* If `x` is a variable-length array `T[]` with `k` elements:
    * `enc(x) = enc(k) enc([x[0], ..., x[k-1]])`, i.e. it’s encoded as if it were a fixed-length array of `k` elements, prefixed with its length, `k`.
* If `x` is an `N`-bit unsigned integer, `uint<N>`:
    * `enc(x)` is the `N`-bit big-endian encoding of `x`.
* If `x` is an `N`-bit unsigned fixed-point decimal number with precision `M`, `ufixed<N>x<M>`:
    * `enc(x) = enc(x * 10^M)`, where `x * 10^M` is interpreted as a `uint<N>`.
* If `x` is a boolean value `bool`:
    * `enc(x)` is a single byte whose **most significant bit** is either 1 or 0, if `x` is true or false respectively. All other bits are 0. Note: this means that a value of true will be encoded as `0x80` (`10000000` in binary) and a value of false will be encoded as `0x00`. This is in contrast to most other encoding schemes, where a value of true is encoded as `0x01`.

Since `string` and `address` are aliases for `byte[]` and `byte[32]`
respectively (and `byte` is an alias for `uint8`), the rules for
encoding these types are covered above.

### "Foreign" Types

Three special types are supported _only_ as the type of a top-level
argument. They may not be used in arrays or tuples, as their encoding
is unusual.

* `account` Represents an Algorand account.
* `asset` Represents an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA)
* `application` Represents an Algorand Smart Contract

Some AVM opcodes require specific values to be placed in the "foreign
arrays" of the application call transaction. These three types allow
methods to describe these requirements. To encode method calls that
have these types as arguments, the value in question is placed in the
Accounts (`apat`), Foreign Assets (`apas`), or Foreign Assets (`apfa`)
arrays, and a uint8 referring to that value is encoded in the normal
location for the value. For the Accounts and Applications array, a 0
implicitly refers to the Sender and the called application
respectively. Therefore, the passed values begin at 1.

When passing addresses, ASAs, or apps that are _not_ required to be
accessed by such opcodes, ARC-4 Contracts **SHOULD** use the base
types for passing these types: `address` and `uint64`.


### Opt In, Close Out, and Clear State.

An ARC-4 app **SHOULD** allow accounts to opt-in and close-out, using
an application call transaction with no arguments an OnCompletion
equal to OptIn (1) or CloseOut (2). Clients **MAY** determine that
opt-in is unnecessary by querying the blockchain for the app's
schema. Opt-in is unnecessary if the app has no local schema.  However,
even if a local schema is present, some methods may be callable
without opt-in. Clients **MAY** attempt method calls without opt-in
and use the failure response to learn that opt-in is required.

Clients **MAY** display the minimum balance increment that such an
opt-in would require.  If an opt-in or close-out contains arguments,
an ARC-4 app **SHOULD** interpret the arguments as an invocation as
described in the rest of this document, to perform along with the
opt-in or close-out.

> Should the ABI allow contracts to specify which methods require
> opt-in?


### Transaction types.

Some apps require that they are invoked as part of a larger
transaction group, containing specific additional transactions.  Seven
addition special types are supported as top-level argument types to
describe such requirements.

* `txn` represents any Algorand transaction
* `pay` represents a PaymentTransaction (algo transfer)
* `keyreg` represents a KeyRegistration transaction (configure
  consensus participation)
* `acfg` represent a AssetConfig transaction (create, configure, or
  destroy ASAs)
* `axfer` represents an AssetTransfer transaction (ASA transfer)
* `afrz` represents an AssetFreezeTx transaction (freeze or unfreeze
  and ASA)
* `appl` represents an ApplicationCallTx transaction (create/invoke a Smart Contract)

Arguments of these types are encoded as consecutive transactions in
the same transaction group as the application call, encoded in the
position immediately preceding the application call. Unlike "foreign"
references, these special types are not encoded as a small integer
"pointing" to the associated object.  In fact, they occupy no space at
all in the Application Call transaction itself. Allowing explicit
references would create opportunities for multiple transaction
"values" to point to the same transaction in the group, which is
undesirable. Instead, the locations of the transactions are implied
entirely by the placement in the argument list.

For example, a Contract might support a method with the signature
"deposit(string,axfer,uint32)void".  To invoke such a method, a client
would create a transaction group containing an asset transfer followed
by the application call.  The application call would contain the
method selector in ApplicationArgs[0], the first (string) argument in
ApplicationArgs[1], and the third (uint32) argument in
ApplicationArgs[2]. If a transaction type appears so late in the
argument list that it would be encoded in a tuple, it occupies no
space.

ARC-4 Apps **SHOULD** be constructed to allow their invocations to be
combined in a single atomic group if they can do so safely. For
example, they should use `txns` to examine the previous index in the
group for a required `pay` transaction, rather than hardcode an index
with `txn`.

## New Features in support of the ABI

Some changes are needed to the Algorand protocol and its tools to
better support this ABI:

* The `log` opcode can be used to return a value.
    * Tracked by [https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues/2349](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues/2349)
* The `extract*` opcodes simplify access to uints embedded in strings.
    * Tracked by [https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues/2347](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/issues/2347)
* A way for indexer to search transactions based on app args (and possibly return value) would be useful to search for calls to specific methods.
* SDKs will need to calculate the method signature and selector for methods given a JSON description of the method/interface.
* The `method` pseudo-op, akin to `addr`, takes a function signature as a string, but inserts the method selector (as bytes) into the program.
    * Tracked by [https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/pull/2358](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/pull/2358)
* A way for apps to call other apps is needed to support calling a method from another contract.
